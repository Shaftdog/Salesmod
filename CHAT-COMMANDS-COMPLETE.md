## 💡 How It Works

### Natural Language → Action

**You type:**
```
"Create an email card for Acme about their Q4 expansion"
```

**System:**
1. Detects "create" command
2. Extracts: type=email, client=Acme, topic=Q4 expansion
3. Finds Acme's client ID in database
4. Calls card management API
5. Creates card in Kanban

**Agent responds:**
```
✅ Created send_email card for Acme Real Estate!
   Title: "their Q4 expansion"
   Priority: medium
   Status: Suggested (go to /agent to review)

I've created the card. The autonomous agent will draft the email 
content, or you can manually add it on the /agent page. Would you 
like me to suggest what the email should say based on our web 
research about iFund being a lending platform?
```

## 🚀 Examples

### Example 1: Create Research Card

**You:** "Create a research task for iFund Cities"

**System Executes:**
```
[Chat] Command detected: {action: 'create', cardType: 'research', clientName: 'iFund'}
[Chat] Found client: ifund Cities (id: abc-123)
[Chat] Creating card via API...
✅ Card created successfully
```

**Agent Responds:**
```
✅ Created research card for ifund Cities!
   Title: "Create a research task for iFund Cities"  
   Priority: medium
   Status: Suggested

The card is ready on your Kanban board. When you approve it or click 
"Start Agent Cycle", the agent will automatically research iFund by:
- Gathering all internal data
- Searching the web (Tavily)
- Creating a comprehensive summary
- Storing in activities, RAG, and memories

Would you like me to execute it now or wait for your review?
```

### Example 2: Create Email Card

**You:** "Draft an email to Acme about volume pricing"

**Agent:**
```
✅ Created send_email card for Acme Real Estate!
   Title: "about volume pricing"
   Priority: medium
   Status: Suggested

I've created the card. Based on our previous conversations and web 
research, here's what I suggest for the email:

Subject: "Exclusive Volume Pricing for Q4 Appraisal Needs"

Content:
- Reference their recent order APR-2025-1001
- Mention their consistent partnership
- Propose 15% discount for 10+ orders
- Emphasize fast turnaround for their timeline
- Include Q4 deadline incentive

The card is on /agent for you to review and approve. Want me to help 
refine the messaging?
```

## 📊 Command Detection

### Automatic Pattern Matching:

**Delete:** "delete", "remove"
**Edit:** "edit", "update", "change"
**Approve:** "approve"
**Reject:** "reject", "dismiss"
**Execute:** "execute", "run"

### Smart Extraction:

**Client names:**
- "for Acme" → Finds "Acme Real Estate"

**Card types:**
- "email" → send_email
- "task" → create_task
- "research" → research

## 🎯 Limitations & Future

### Current (v1):
- ✅ Can create cards
- ⏳ Edit/delete need card numbers (will add UI helpers)
- ⏳ Bulk operations basic (can enhance)

### Future Enhancements:
- Card search by keywords
- Bulk approve by criteria
- Scheduled commands
- Conditional logic
- Multi-step workflows

**But v1 is already powerful!**
