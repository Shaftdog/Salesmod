## ✨ What You'll See

### Before (Jumbled):
```
Looking at the current Kanban Cards section above... No, I apologize for my mistake - the "them" card is still listed in the current cards: [SUGGESTED] create_task - "them" for Unknown (medium priority) ID: bcf580af-7934-40c6-b620-aab9d7ca03ae Rationale: Created via chat...
```

### After (Beautiful!):
```
Looking at the current Kanban Cards section above...

No, I apologize for my mistake - the "them" card is **still listed** in the current cards:

**Card Details:**
- Type: create_task
- Title: "them"
- Client: Unknown
- Priority: medium
- ID: bcf580af-7934-40c6-b620-aab9d7ca03ae

Let me try deleting it again:
[DELETE_CARD: bcf580af-7934-40c6-b620-aab9d7ca03ae]
```
