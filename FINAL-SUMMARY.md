## 📊 Implementation Stats

- **Code Written:** ~3,500 lines
- **Files Created:** 15 new files
- **Components Built:** 4 major UI components
- **API Endpoints:** 4 routes
- **Database Tables:** 7 tables
- **React Hooks:** 10 hooks

## 🎓 How It Works

```
Every 2 Hours:
  1. Agent analyzes goals → calculates pressure
  2. Ranks clients → by RFM + engagement
  3. AI generates plan → 3-7 actions
  4. Creates Kanban cards → all in "Suggested"
  5. Waits for approval → Review mode
  6. User approves → executes actions
  7. Logs results → writes reflection
  8. Learns → adjusts for next cycle
```

---

## 🔒 Safety Features

- ✅ **Review Mode Only** - All actions require approval
- ✅ **Email Suppressions** - Automatic bounce/complaint blocking
- ✅ **Daily Limits** - Max 50 emails per day (configurable)
- ✅ **Cooldown Periods** - 5 days between contacts
- ✅ **Quiet Hours** - No sends 10pm-8am
- ✅ **RLS Policies** - Data isolated by user
- ✅ **Idempotency** - No duplicate runs
- ✅ **Error Handling** - Graceful failures

---

## 🚀 After Setup

Once you run the SQL file, you can:

1. **Trigger manually:**
   - Go to /agent
   - Click "Start Agent Cycle"
   - Review proposed actions

2. **Approve cards:**

4. **Let it run automatically:**
