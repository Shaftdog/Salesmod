# üîç Automated Research System - COMPLETE!

## ‚úÖ What Was Just Implemented

Your AI agent can now automatically research clients by:
- ‚úÖ Gathering all internal data (orders, activities, contacts, deals)
- ‚úÖ Searching the web for company information (optional)
- ‚úÖ Summarizing findings with AI
- ‚úÖ Storing results in 3 places (activities, RAG, memories)
- ‚úÖ Making research searchable and referenceable forever

---

## üéØ How It Works

### When You Approve a Research Card:

**Step 1: Internal Data Gathering** (~2-3 seconds)
```
Searches YOUR database:
- All orders from this client
- All activities (emails, calls, notes)
- All contacts
- All deals
- Payment history
- Calculates metrics (revenue, frequency, etc.)
```

**Step 2: Web Search** (~3-5 seconds) - Optional
```
If API key configured:
- Searches: "[Company Name] company information business"
- Gets 5 best results
- Extracts: title, URL, snippet

If no API key:
- Skips this step
- Uses internal data only (still valuable!)
```

**Step 3: AI Summarization** (~5-10 seconds)
```
Claude analyzes:
- Internal data
- Web results
- Creates comprehensive summary with:
  1. Company Overview
  2. Our Relationship History
  3. Current Status & Activity
  4. Engagement Opportunities
  5. Recommended Next Actions
  6. Risk Factors
```

**Step 4-6: Storage** (~2-3 seconds)
```
Saves to THREE places:
1. Activities table ‚Üí Visible in client timeline
2. RAG (embeddings_index) ‚Üí Searchable forever
3. Agent memories ‚Üí Auto-loaded in future planning
```

**Total Time: ~12-24 seconds**

**Result: Comprehensive client research stored forever!**

## üìä Where Research Gets Stored

### 1. Activities Table (Timeline View)
**Location:** `activities` table  
**Type:** 'note'  
**Subject:** "Research Complete: [Client Name]"  
**Description:** Full AI summary

**Visible:**
- Client detail page timeline
- Activity logs
- Can be viewed/shared

**Example:**
```
Subject: Research Complete: iFund Cities
Description:
# Research Summary: iFund Cities

## 1. Company Overview
Real estate investment firm specializing in commercial 
properties...

## 2. Our Relationship History
- Total Orders: 1
- Total Revenue: $1,250
- Last Order: 999 days ago
[...]
```

### 2. RAG Knowledge Base (Searchable)
**Location:** `embeddings_index` table  
**Source:** 'research'  
**Title:** "Research: [Client Name]"  
**Embedding:** 1536-dim vector

**Searchable via:**
- Chat: "Tell me about iFund"
- Chat: "Find research on iFund"
- Chat: "What do we know about iFund?"
- Future planning: Agent auto-loads relevant research

**Example:**
When you ask "Tell me about iFund Cities", agent:
1. Searches RAG with vector similarity
2. Finds research summary (high similarity score)
3. Reads the full research
4. Responds with context from the research

### 3. Agent Memories (Auto-Loaded)
**Location:** `agent_memories` table  
**Scope:** 'client_context'  
**Key:** `research_[clientId]_[timestamp]`  
**Importance:** 0.8 (high)

**Used for:**
- Future action planning
- Email drafting context
- Strategic recommendations
- Agent's "long-term memory"

**Example:**
```json
{
  "client_id": "abc-123",
  "client_name": "iFund Cities",
  "summary": "Real estate investment firm, dormant 999 days...",
  "opportunities": [
    "Volume package for Q4 expansion",
    "Fast-turnaround service positioning"
  ],
  "metrics": {
    "totalOrders": 1,
    "totalRevenue": 1250,
    "daysSinceLastOrder": 999
  }
}
```

## üéØ How Agent Uses Research

### Scenario 1: Future Email Drafting

**Next time agent creates email for iFund:**
```
Agent loads from memories:
- "iFund is expanding Q4 2025"
- "They need fast-turnaround services"
- "999 days dormant, rebuild relationship"

Agent drafts email:
"Hi [Name], I noticed iFund Cities is expanding its portfolio this Q4. 
Given the fast-paced nature of acquisitions, I wanted to reach out about 
our expedited appraisal services..."

‚ú® Context-aware messaging based on research!
```

### Scenario 2: Chat Conversation

**You:** "Tell me about iFund"

**Agent:**
```
(Searches RAG, finds research from last week)

Based on research conducted on October 15th:

iFund Cities is a real estate investment firm currently expanding 
their Q4 portfolio. We haven't contacted them in 999 days, but our 
previous relationship was positive (1 order, $1,250, paid on time).

Key opportunities:
- They're acquiring properties Q4 (perfect timing!)
- Need fast-turnaround appraisals
- Volume package could be attractive

I already created a re-engagement email. Should we send it?
```

### Scenario 3: Strategic Planning

**During next agent run:**
```
Agent checks memories before planning:
- Loads: "iFund research showed Q4 expansion"
- Prioritizes: iFund higher due to timing
- Creates: Email emphasizing fast service + volume pricing
- Rationale: "Recent research shows Q4 expansion needs"

‚ú® Research informs future agent decisions!
```
