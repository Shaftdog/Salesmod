# 🚀 START HERE - Complete Agent Setup in 2 Minutes!

## What You Need
✅ UI is already working (tested with browser automation)  
✅ Dev server is running on http://localhost:9002  
✅ All code is written and ready  
⏳ **Just need to run ONE SQL file in Supabase**

---

## Simple 3-Step Setup

### Step 1: Open Supabase SQL Editor (30 seconds)

1. Go to: https://supabase.com/dashboard/project/zqhenxhgcjxslpfezybm
2. Log in if prompted
3. Click **"SQL Editor"** in the left sidebar
4. Click **"New Query"**

### Step 2: Run the Setup SQL (30 seconds)

1. Open the file: **`RUN-THIS-IN-SUPABASE.sql`** (in this folder)
2. Select ALL content (Cmd+A or Ctrl+A)
3. Copy it (Cmd+C or Ctrl+C)
4. Paste into the Supabase SQL Editor
5. Click **"Run"** button

You'll see output like:
```
✓ TABLES CREATED SUCCESSFULLY
✓ Agent settings initialized
✓ Test goal created
🎉 SETUP COMPLETE!
```

### Step 3: Test the Agent! (1 minute)

1. Go to: http://localhost:9002/agent
2. Click **"Agent Control Panel"** button
3. Click **"Start Agent Cycle"**
4. Watch the AI create action cards! 🎉

---

## What Happens Next?

The agent will:
1. ✅ Analyze your goals (now has: $100k/month revenue target)
2. ✅ Rank your clients by priority
3. ✅ Generate 3-7 intelligent action proposals
4. ✅ Create cards on the Kanban board
5. ✅ Wait for your approval (Review mode)

Then you can:
- 📧 Click cards to review email drafts
- ✅ Approve actions with one click
- 📊 Track performance metrics
- 🔄 Run again anytime

---

## Troubleshooting

**If SQL fails with "relation already exists":**
- ✅ That's fine! It means tables already exist
- ✅ The script will skip existing items and continue
- ✅ Check the final verification output

**If "Start Agent Cycle" doesn't work:**
1. Check browser console for errors (F12)
2. Make sure ANTHROPIC_API_KEY is set in .env.local
3. Look at terminal where dev server is running

**If no cards are created:**
- Agent needs at least 1 active client in your database
- Check: Do you have clients? Go to /clients page
- Agent will still run but won't have much to suggest
