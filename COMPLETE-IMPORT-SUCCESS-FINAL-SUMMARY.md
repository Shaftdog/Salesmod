## 🎯 Capabilities Enabled

### Automated Workflows:
```sql
-- Complexity-based pricing
SELECT 
  order_number,
  fee_amount * 
    CASE scope_of_work
      WHEN 'interior' THEN 1.5
      WHEN 'exterior_only' THEN 1.0
    END as calculated_price
FROM orders;
```

### Intelligent Routing:
```sql
-- Find orders for specific appraiser skills
SELECT * FROM orders
WHERE scope_of_work = 'interior'
  AND service_region = 'ORL-SW-PRIMARY'
  AND status = 'new';
```

### Marketing ROI:
```sql
-- Revenue by campaign
SELECT 
  sales_campaign,
  COUNT(*) as orders,
  SUM(fee_amount) as revenue
FROM orders
GROUP BY sales_campaign;
```

### Compliance Validation:
```sql
-- Flag form mismatches
SELECT * FROM orders
WHERE intended_use LIKE '%FHA%'
  AND report_form_type NOT LIKE 'FHA%';
```
