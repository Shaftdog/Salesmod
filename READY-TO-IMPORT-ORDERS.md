## Your Files Ready to Use

### Migration SQL
📄 `supabase/migrations/20251024000000_add_appraisal_workflow_fields.sql`
- Run this in Supabase SQL Editor FIRST
- Adds all workflow columns to orders table

### Clean CSV Data
📄 `October_Orders_Consolidated.csv`
- 20 orders with consolidated client field
- Ready for import through Migration Wizard

### Documentation
📄 `APPRAISAL-WORKFLOW-FIELDS-COMPLETE.md`
- Complete field reference
- SQL examples for pricing, routing, analytics
- Query performance benchmarks

## Quick Start: 3 Steps to Import

### Step 1: Run the Migration (5 minutes)

Open **Supabase SQL Editor** and run:

```sql
-- Copy/paste the entire contents of:
-- supabase/migrations/20251024000000_add_appraisal_workflow_fields.sql
```

This adds 14 new columns to your orders table.

### Step 2: Verify Columns Were Added

Run this query:

```sql
SELECT column_name, data_type
FROM information_schema.columns
WHERE table_name = 'orders'
  AND column_name IN (
    'scope_of_work', 'intended_use', 'report_form_type',
    'billing_method', 'sales_campaign', 'service_region'
  );
```

You should see 6+ new columns.

### Step 3: Import Your Orders (10 minutes)

1. Go to **Migrations** → **Import Wizard**
2. Select:
   - Source: **Asana Orders**
   - Entity: **Orders**
   - Method: **CSV Upload**
3. Upload: `October_Orders_Consolidated.csv`
4. Configure:
   - Duplicate Strategy: **Update Existing**
   - Auto-Link Properties: ✅ **Enabled**
5. Click **"Proceed with Import"**

The system will automatically:
- ✅ Parse addresses and create properties
- ✅ Match clients by name
- ✅ Transform all workflow fields
- ✅ Validate enum values
- ✅ Link properties to orders

## What You'll Get

### 20 Orders Imported With:

✅ **Full address data** - Parsed and linked to properties
✅ **Clean workflow fields** - scope_of_work, intended_use, etc.
✅ **Client associations** - Matched to existing clients
✅ **Pricing data** - fee_amount, additional_forms
✅ **Marketing attribution** - sales_campaign tracking
✅ **Scheduling info** - inspection_date, due_date
✅ **Compliance data** - zoning_type, multiunit flags

### Example Query After Import:

```sql
SELECT 
  order_number,
  client_id,
  property_address,
  scope_of_work,
  intended_use,
  report_form_type,
  additional_forms,
  billing_method,
  sales_campaign,
  service_region,
  fee_amount,
  status
FROM orders
WHERE source = 'asana'
ORDER BY ordered_date DESC;
```

## Your 8 Clients to Verify

Before importing, make sure these clients exist in your database:

1. **I Fund Cities** - 6 orders
2. **Applied Valuation Services** - 5 orders
3. **Allstate Appraisal** - 3 orders
4. **Consolidated Analytics** - 2 orders
5. **Marcus Ellington** - 1 order
6. **Property Rate** - 1 order
7. **Yunior Castroy** - 1 order
8. **ThinkLattice LLC** - 1 order

**Quick check**:
```sql
SELECT company_name 
FROM clients 
WHERE LOWER(company_name) IN (
  'i fund cities',
  'applied valuation services',
  'allstate appraisal',
  'consolidated analytics',
  'marcus ellington',
  'property rate',
  'yunior castroy',
  'thinklattice llc'
);
```

If any are missing, create them first or they'll be assigned to "[Unassigned Orders]".

## New Capabilities Enabled

With workflow fields in dedicated columns, you can now:

### 1. Smart Pricing
```sql
-- Calculate order complexity score
SELECT 
  order_number,
  CASE scope_of_work
    WHEN 'interior' THEN 3
    WHEN 'exterior_only' THEN 2
    WHEN 'desktop' THEN 1
  END +
  CASE WHEN site_influence = 'water' THEN 2 ELSE 0 END +
  CASE WHEN is_multiunit THEN 2 ELSE 0 END +
  array_length(additional_forms, 1) as complexity_score
FROM orders;
```

### 2. Assignment Routing
```sql
-- Find orders ready for assignment in a region
SELECT order_number, scope_of_work, service_region
FROM orders
WHERE status = 'new'
  AND service_region = 'ORL-SW-PRIMARY'
  AND scope_of_work = 'interior'
ORDER BY due_date;
```

### 3. Campaign ROI
```sql
-- Revenue by marketing campaign
SELECT 
  sales_campaign,
  COUNT(*) as orders,
  SUM(total_amount) as revenue
FROM orders
WHERE sales_campaign IS NOT NULL
GROUP BY sales_campaign
ORDER BY revenue DESC;
```

### 4. Compliance Checks
```sql
-- Flag orders needing specific forms
SELECT order_number, intended_use, report_form_type
FROM orders
WHERE intended_use LIKE '%FHA%'
  AND report_form_type NOT LIKE 'FHA%';
```

## Next Steps After Import
