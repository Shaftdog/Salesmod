## 💡 How Delete Now Works

### Enhanced Matching:
**Delete finds cards by:**
1. **Priority** - "delete low priority cards"
2. **Type** - "delete email cards", "delete research tasks"
3. **Client** - "delete iFund cards"
4. **Title keywords** - partial matching
5. **Exact UUID** - "delete card abc-123..."

### Execution Flow:
```
User: "Delete all low priority cards"
↓
Chat API detects "delete" command
↓
Loads Kanban cards (20 recent)
↓
Filters cards matching criteria
↓
Calls /api/agent/card/delete for each match
↓
Database DELETE executed
↓
Returns: "✅ Deleted X cards: [list]"
↓
User refreshes /agent → Cards gone!
```

## 🧪 To Test Again

### Create Some Test Cards First:

**Method 1: Via Chat**
```
"Create a task to test deletion"
"Create another task for testing"
"Create a low priority email card for Acme"
```

**Method 2: Via Agent Run**
- Click "Start Agent Cycle"
- Agent creates new cards
- Then test deleting them

### Then Test Delete:

```
"What cards are on the board?"
→ Agent lists all cards

"Delete all low priority cards"
→ Agent deletes and confirms

"What cards are left?"
→ Agent shows remaining cards
```
