## 🎊 Hybrid Approach (Chosen Strategy)

**Chat = Intelligence** (Questions, Search, Advice)
- "What are my goals?" → Agent analyzes
- "Search for iFund" → Agent searches web
- "How can I close the gap?" → Agent advises

**Autonomous Agent = Actions** (Creates, Executes)
- Runs every 2 hours
- Creates action cards
- Proposes emails, tasks, calls, deals

**UI = Approvals** (Review, Approve, Execute)
- Review cards on Kanban
- Approve with one click
- Execute immediately

**Together = Complete System!**
