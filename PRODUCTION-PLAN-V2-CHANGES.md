- ‚úÖ Operational readiness (runbooks, DR, incidents)
- ‚úÖ Concrete implementation (50+ code examples)
- ‚úÖ Clear next steps (Phase 0 ‚Üí Week 1)

**Bottom Line**: 
- Old plan: Good foundation, too optimistic
- New plan: Production-grade, enterprise-ready, realistic

**Success depends on**:
1. Following phases sequentially
2. Not skipping security steps
3. Testing thoroughly
4. Tracking progress honestly

Good luck! You've got this. üéâ
