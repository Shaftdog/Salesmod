## üí¨ Example Conversations

### Ask About Pending Work:

**You:** "What cards are pending?"

**Agent:**
```
You have 22 cards in the Suggested column:

HIGH PRIORITY:
1. [SUGGESTED] Email - "Urgent outreach to Acme RE for Q4" 
   Client: Acme Real Estate
   Why: High priority score and engagement score
   
2. [SUGGESTED] Deal - "Create Q4 portfolio opportunity for Acme"
   Client: Acme Real Estate  
   Value: Likely high-value
   
3. [SUGGESTED] Research - "Research iFund Cities recent market activity"
   Client: iFund Cities
   Why: Need context before outreach

Plus 19 more cards in Suggested column.
Plus 1 card in Approved column (ready to execute).

Would you like me to help you prioritize which to approve first?
```

### Ask About Specific Client:

**You:** "What cards do we have for iFund?"

**Agent:**
```
I can see 3 cards for iFund Cities:

1. [SUGGESTED] Email - "Re-engagement email to iFund Cities"
   Priority: High
   Why: 999 days no contact, highest RFM score
   
2. [SUGGESTED] Research - "Research iFund recent market activity"
   Priority: Medium
   Why: Need current context for follow-up
   
3. [SUGGESTED] Deal - "iFund Cities Reactivation Opportunity"
   Priority: High
   Why: Track potential Q4 volume commitment

Based on my web search earlier, iFund is a lending platform for real 
estate investors. I recommend:
1. Approve the research card first (gather intel)
2. Then approve the email (re-engage with context)
3. Then create the deal (structured opportunity)

Want me to help draft the email content?
```

### Ask for Recommendations:

**You:** "Which card should I focus on first?"

**Agent:**
```
Looking at your 22 pending cards, I recommend focusing on:

TOP PRIORITY:
1. [APPROVED] Research iFund Cities (high priority)
   - Already approved, ready to execute
   - Will gather comprehensive intel
   - Execute by clicking "Start Agent Cycle"

2. [SUGGESTED] Email to Acme (high priority, score: 7.4)
   - Acme has highest engagement score
   - Recent activity = warm lead
   - Approve this for next cycle

3. [SUGGESTED] Q4 Deal for Acme ($15k opportunity)
   - Structured opportunity worth $15,000
   - Aligns with revenue gap goals
   - Approve to track pipeline

Recommendation: Click "Start Agent Cycle" now to:
- Execute the approved research
- Then approve the Acme email and deal

This addresses your highest-priority opportunities first.
```

## üéØ What Agent Can Now See

**For Each Card:**
- ID (for commands like "delete card abc-123")
- Type (email, task, research, deal, call)
- Title
- State (suggested, in_review, approved)
- Priority (high, medium, low)
- Client name
- Rationale (why agent created it)

**Agent knows:**
- How many cards total
- How many in each state
- Which are high priority
- Which clients have cards
- What actions are proposed

## üí° Smart Interactions

### Avoid Duplicates:

**You:** "Create a research card for iFund"

**Agent:**
```
I can see we already have a research card for iFund Cities:
- Title: "Research iFund recent market activity"
- State: Suggested
- Priority: Medium

Would you like me to:
1. Approve this existing card?
2. Create a different research card with different scope?
3. Update the existing card to higher priority?
```

### Contextual Advice:

**You:** "Should I create an email for Acme?"

**Agent:**
```
I can see we already have 2 cards for Acme Real Estate:

1. Email - "Urgent outreach to Acme RE for Q4" (High priority)
2. Deal - "Create Q4 portfolio opportunity" (High priority)

Rather than creating a new one, I recommend:
- Approve the existing email card
- It's already drafted and ready
- Click "Start Agent Cycle" to send it

Want me to review what's in that email first?
```
