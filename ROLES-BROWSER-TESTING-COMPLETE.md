## Database Status

### ✅ What Works NOW (Without Full Migration)

**The migration partially ran:**
- ✅ `party_roles` table exists with all 40 roles
- ✅ All queries to `party_roles` work (status 200)
- ✅ Role dropdowns load successfully
- ✅ Role data displays in forms

**What's Missing:**
- ⚠️ `primary_role_code` column on `contacts` table
- ⚠️ `primary_role_code` column on `clients` table

**Result:**
- Clients can save roles (column already added)
- Contacts can't save roles yet (column missing)
- UI is fully functional and ready

## Issues Fixed During Testing

### Issue #1: Select Empty String Error
**Problem**: Select component doesn't allow empty string values  
**Fix**: Changed "No Role" value from `""` to `"__none__"`  
**File**: `src/components/shared/role-select.tsx`  
**Status**: ✅ Fixed

### Issue #2: Contacts Not Loading
**Problem**: Ambiguous FK relationship between contacts↔clients  
**Fix**: Used explicit FK name `clients!contacts_client_id_fkey(*)`  
**Files**: 
- `src/hooks/use-contacts.ts`
- `src/hooks/use-contact-detail.ts`  
**Status**: ✅ Fixed

### Issue #3: Migration Policy Error
**Problem**: RLS policy "Anyone can view party_roles" already exists  
**Fix**: Added `DROP POLICY IF EXISTS` before creating  
**File**: `supabase/migrations/20251020100000_add_party_roles.sql`  
**Status**: ✅ Fixed

## Next Steps

### To Complete Implementation:

**Run the full migration** in your Supabase SQL Editor:

```sql
-- Copy/paste the entire contents of:
supabase/migrations/20251020100000_add_party_roles.sql
```

This will:
1. Create `party_roles` table (already done ✅)
2. Add `primary_role_code` column to `contacts` (needed!)
3. Add `primary_role_code` column to `clients` (already done ✅)
4. Create indexes and RLS policies

### After Migration:

1. **Refresh browser** - roles will persist properly
2. **Edit contacts** - roles will save to database
3. **Import data** - HubSpot/CSV imports will map roles automatically
4. **Run backfill** - Existing data gets categorized

## Files Modified for Testing Fixes

1. `src/components/shared/role-select.tsx` - Fixed empty string issue
2. `src/hooks/use-contacts.ts` - Fixed FK ambiguity
3. `src/hooks/use-contact-detail.ts` - Fixed FK ambiguity
4. `src/app/(app)/clients/[id]/page.tsx` - Added inline role editor
5. `supabase/migrations/20251020100000_add_party_roles.sql` - Fixed idempotency
