## Future Prevention

**I enhanced the address parser** to prevent this!

**Now handles:**
- "10 N Ohio St Orlando, FL 32805" ✅ (was failing)
- "1012 Diego Ct Lady Lake, FL 32159" ✅ (was failing)
- All standard formats ✅

**Recommendation**: Update Asana form to use 4 separate address fields (Street, City, State, ZIP) for 100% accuracy.

See `PREVENT-ADDRESS-PARSING-ISSUES.md` for details.
