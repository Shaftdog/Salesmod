## 📧 Email Example

Here's what the AI might generate:

**Subject:** "Following up on your recent appraisal order"

**To:** john@acmerealestate.com

**Body:**
```
Hi John,

I hope this email finds you well! I wanted to follow up on the appraisal we recently completed for your property on [address].

I noticed you've been working with us consistently, and I wanted to reach out to see if there are any other properties you need appraised this month. We're looking to accelerate our services for valued clients like Acme Real Estate.

Would you be open to a quick call this week to discuss:
- Any upcoming appraisal needs
- Potential volume pricing options
- How we can better support your timeline

Let me know a time that works for you, or feel free to call me directly.

Best regards,
Account Manager
ROI Companies
```

**Rationale:**
"Client has 1 active order but no contact in 7+ days. Revenue goals are significantly behind target (98.8%). High-value client with consistent needs. Opportunity to discuss volume business and close revenue gap before month end."

## 🔍 Quick Troubleshooting

### If No Cards Appear

Check terminal logs:
```bash
tail -50 /tmp/next-dev.log | grep -i error
```

Check database for errors:
```sql
SELECT errors FROM agent_runs ORDER BY started_at DESC LIMIT 1;
```

### If Still Getting "Unauthorized"

- Refresh the page (Ctrl/Cmd + R)
- Log out and log back in
- Clear browser cache

### If Agent Creates 0 Actions

Your data might be perfect (no actions needed), or:
- Goals might not be set up
- Clients might not have contacts/emails
- Check agent_runs.errors in database

---

## 📈 Expected Results

**With Your Current Data:**

Goals:
- 3 active goals (all far behind target)
- High goal pressure (should be 90%+)

Clients:
- 2 active clients  
- Both have recent orders
- Agent should prioritize both

**Agent Should Create:**
- 4-6 action cards
- At least 2-3 email drafts
- Maybe 1-2 tasks or deals
