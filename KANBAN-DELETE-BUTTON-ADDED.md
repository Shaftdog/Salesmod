## ✨ Features

### Smart Delete Button

- **Can't undo warning** - Clear about consequences
- **Cancel option** - Easy to back out

### User Feedback
- **Success toast** - "Card Deleted: '[Card Name]' has been deleted"
- **Error toast** - Shows error message if deletion fails
- **Instant update** - Kanban refreshes automatically

## 🔧 Technical Details

### What Was Implemented

**1. New Hook: `useDeleteCard`** (`src/hooks/use-agent.ts`)
```typescript
export function useDeleteCard() {
  const queryClient = useQueryClient();

  return useMutation({
    mutationFn: async (cardId: string) => {
      const supabase = createClient();
      const { error } = await supabase
        .from('kanban_cards')
        .delete()
        .eq('id', cardId);

      if (error) throw error;
      return { success: true };
    },
    onSuccess: () => {
      queryClient.invalidateQueries({ queryKey: ['kanban-cards'] });
    },
  });
}
```

**2. Updated Kanban Component** (`src/components/agent/kanban-board.tsx`)
- Added delete button to each card (Trash2 icon)
- Button appears on hover with `group-hover:opacity-100`
- Red styling on hover: `hover:bg-red-100 hover:text-red-600`
- Click stops propagation to prevent opening card details

**3. Confirmation Dialog**
- Uses AlertDialog component
- Shows card title in confirmation message
- Red "Delete" button for clear action
- Cancel button to abort

**4. State Management**
```typescript
const [cardToDelete, setCardToDelete] = useState<KanbanCard | null>(null);

// When delete clicked
onDelete={() => setCardToDelete(card)}

// Dialog open state
<AlertDialog open={!!cardToDelete} onOpenChange={...}>
```
