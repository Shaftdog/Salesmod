# 🧠 Intelligent Memory Management - COMPLETE!

## ✅ What Was Just Implemented

Your Account Manager Agent now has **3-tier intelligent memory** that:
- Keeps recent chat for immediate context (30 days)
- Preserves important decisions forever (agent_memories)
- Makes all conversations searchable forever (RAG)
- Auto-cleans expired data (keeps database fast)

---

## 🎯 The 3-Tier System

### Tier 1: Recent Chat (30 Days)
**Where:** `chat_messages` table  
**Purpose:** Full conversation history for recent context  
**Retention:** 30 days (configurable)  
**Cleanup:** Automatic daily at 2am

**What you see:**
- Last 30 days of full chat history
- Every message preserved
- Scroll through recent conversations

### Tier 2: Important Memories (Forever)
**Where:** `agent_memories` table (scope='chat')  
**Purpose:** Preserved summaries of key conversations  
**Retention:** Permanent  
**Cleanup:** Never deleted

**What's preserved:**
- Strategic decisions
- Goal discussions
- Client insights
- Action plans
- Important preferences

### Tier 3: Searchable Knowledge (Forever)
**Where:** `embeddings_index` (RAG)  
**Purpose:** Semantic search over all conversations  
**Retention:** Permanent  
**Cleanup:** Never deleted

**What's searchable:**
- Past conversations grouped by topic
- Vector embeddings for similarity search
- Find old discussions instantly
- Agent can reference months-old chats

---

## 📊 What Happens Daily

### At 2:00 AM (Automatic Cron Job):

**Step 1: Preserve Context**
```
1. Find conversations from yesterday
2. Summarize key points
3. Save to agent_memories (scope='chat')
4. Mark as high importance (0.8)
5. Set to never expire
```

**Step 2: Index to RAG**
```
1. Group messages into conversations
2. Generate vector embeddings
3. Store in embeddings_index
4. Make searchable via semantic similarity
```

**Step 3: Cleanup Expired**
```
1. Find messages older than 30 days
2. Delete them (already preserved in steps 1-2!)
3. Keep database fast and lean
```

## 💬 Real-World Example

### October 15: Important Strategy Discussion

**Your Chat:**
```
You: "Should I focus on new clients or existing ones?"
Agent: "Based on your $98k revenue gap with 17 days left, I recommend..."
You: "Let's prioritize Acme. Draft that Q4 email"
Agent: "Created! Here's the $15k package proposal..."
You: "Perfect, approve it"
```

**What Gets Saved:**

**Tier 1 (chat_messages):**
```
Full conversation stored for 30 days
```

**Tier 2 (agent_memories):**
```json
{
  "scope": "chat",
  "key": "conversation_summary_2025-10-15",
  "content": {
    "summary": "User decided to prioritize existing clients (Acme) over new acquisition. Approved $15k Q4 package proposal.",
    "decisions": ["Focus on Acme", "Approve Q4 email"],
    "topics": ["revenue strategy", "client prioritization"]
  },
  "importance": 0.8,
  "expires_at": null
}
```

**Tier 3 (embeddings_index - RAG):**
```
Title: "Conversation on 10/15/2025: Should I focus on new clients..."
Content: [Full conversation]
Embedding: [1536-dim vector]
Searchable via: "client prioritization", "revenue strategy", "Acme focus"
```

### November 20: 36 Days Later

**Raw Chat:**
- ❌ Deleted (>30 days old)

**But Agent Still Knows:**
```
You: "What was our strategy for Acme again?"

Agent searches:
- agent_memories → Finds October 15 summary
- RAG → Finds full conversation via semantic search

Agent responds:
"Last month on October 15th, you decided to prioritize existing clients, 
specifically Acme, over new client acquisition. You approved a $15k Q4 
package proposal. Would you like to review how that's progressing?"
```

**The agent remembers even though the raw chat is gone!** 🧠✨

## 🎯 What You Need to Do

### Immediate (2 Minutes):

Run this in **Supabase SQL Editor**:

**File:** `supabase/migrations/20251015130000_chat_cleanup_and_memory.sql`

This enables:
- Auto-expiry (30 days)
- Preservation functions
- Cleanup functions

### Optional (Test Now):

In browser console at http://localhost:9002/agent:

```javascript
// Index your current chats into RAG
fetch('/api/rag/index-all', { method: 'POST' })
  .then(r => r.json())
  .then(console.log);

// Check cleanup status
fetch('/api/agent/chat/cleanup')
  .then(r => r.json())
  .then(console.log);
```

### Production (When Deploying):

The cron job is already configured in `vercel.json` to run daily at 2am!

## 🔍 How Agent Will Use This

**When you ask a question:**

1. **Check recent chat** (last 30 days)
   - Loads via `useChatMessages` hook
   - Full conversation context

2. **Search agent_memories** (scope='chat')
   - Finds summaries of old conversations
   - References past decisions

3. **Search RAG** (embeddings_index)
   - Semantic search over all indexed chats
   - Finds relevant old discussions
   - Cites specific conversations

**Result:** The agent has full context from recent AND old conversations!
