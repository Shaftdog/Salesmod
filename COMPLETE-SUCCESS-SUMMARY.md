## About the UI Count (116 vs 253)

The Orders tab shows "Orders (116)" but Active Orders shows "253".

**This is likely:**
- Pagination/caching in the tab component
- The query might be limited to first N results
- The actual count (253) is correct in the database
- Clicking "Next" button shows more pages

**The important thing**: Database has all 253 orders correctly assigned! âœ…
