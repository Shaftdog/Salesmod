## Action Items

### 🔴 URGENT: Create Missing Clients

6 clients from your orders don't exist in the database yet:

1. **Marcus Ellington** - 1 order ($450)
2. **Allstate Appraisal** - 3 orders (est. $1,300)
3. **Consolidated Analytics** - 2 orders (est. $800)
4. **Property Rate** - 1 order ($500)
5. **Yunior Castroy** - 1 order ($450)
6. **ThinkLattice LLC** - 1 order ($345)

**How to Create:**

**Option A: Use Migrations Tab**
1. Create a CSV with these 6 clients
2. Import as "Companies (Clients)"
3. Include: company_name, email, phone, address

**Option B: Manual Creation**
1. Go to Clients page
2. Click "New Client"
3. Fill in details for each

**Option C: SQL Bulk Insert**
```sql
INSERT INTO clients (company_name, primary_contact, email, phone, address, billing_address)
VALUES 
  ('Marcus Ellington', 'Marcus Ellington', 'contact@marcusellington.com', '000-000-0000', 'TBD', 'TBD'),
  ('Allstate Appraisal', 'Primary Contact', 'contact@allstateappraisal.com', '000-000-0000', 'TBD', 'TBD'),
  ('Consolidated Analytics', 'Primary Contact', 'contact@consolidatedanalytics.com', '000-000-0000', 'TBD', 'TBD'),
  ('Property Rate', 'Property Rate', 'contact@propertyrate.com', '000-000-0000', 'TBD', 'TBD'),
  ('Yunior Castroy', 'Yunior Castroy', 'yohanny.castro96@gmail.com', '305-244-7702', 'TBD', 'TBD'),
  ('ThinkLattice LLC', 'Primary Contact', 'contact@thinklattice.com', '000-000-0000', 'TBD', 'TBD');
```

### 📝 Then Reassign Orders

After creating clients, update the orders:

```sql
-- Reassign orders to correct clients
UPDATE orders o
SET client_id = (SELECT id FROM clients WHERE company_name = 'Allstate Appraisal' LIMIT 1)
WHERE o.client_id = (SELECT id FROM clients WHERE company_name = '[Unassigned Orders]')
  AND o.props->>'amc_client' = 'Allstate Appraisal';

-- Repeat for other clients...
```

---

## What's Now Possible

### 1. Intelligent Assignment Routing 🚀
```sql
-- Find best appraiser for order
SELECT * FROM orders
WHERE status = 'new'
  AND scope_of_work = 'interior'
  AND service_region = 'ORL-SW-PRIMARY'
  AND is_multiunit = false
ORDER BY due_date;
```

### 2. Automated Pricing 💰
```sql
-- Calculate order complexity
SELECT 
  order_number,
  fee_amount as base_fee,
  CASE scope_of_work
    WHEN 'interior' THEN 1.5
    WHEN 'exterior_only' THEN 1.0  
    WHEN 'desktop' THEN 0.7
  END as scope_multiplier,
  CASE WHEN site_influence = 'water' THEN 1.2 ELSE 1.0 END as site_multiplier,
  array_length(additional_forms, 1) * 75 as forms_fee
FROM orders;
```

### 3. Marketing ROI 📊
```sql
-- Revenue by campaign
SELECT 
  sales_campaign,
  COUNT(*) as orders,
  SUM(total_amount) as revenue
FROM orders
WHERE sales_campaign IS NOT NULL
GROUP BY sales_campaign
ORDER BY revenue DESC;
```

### 4. Compliance Checking ✅
```sql
-- Validate form types
SELECT order_number, intended_use, report_form_type
FROM orders
WHERE intended_use LIKE '%FHA%'
  AND report_form_type NOT LIKE 'FHA%';
```
