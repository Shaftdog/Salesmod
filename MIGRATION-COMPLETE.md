# ✅ Migration Complete: Firebase → Supabase + Vercel

## 🎉 What Was Done

### ✅ Critical Fixes
- ✅ Removed dangerous `ignoreBuildErrors` and `ignoreDuringBuilds` from Next.js config
- ✅ Fixed duplicate detection to use Zustand store instead of static data
- ✅ Fixed dashboard to compute real stats from actual data

### ✅ Dependencies
- ✅ Removed Firebase, Genkit, and related packages
- ✅ Installed Supabase (`@supabase/supabase-js`, `@supabase/ssr`)
- ✅ Installed Vercel AI SDK (`ai`, `@ai-sdk/openai`, `@ai-sdk/anthropic`)

### ✅ Supabase Integration
- ✅ Created Supabase client utilities:
  - `src/lib/supabase/client.ts` - Browser client
  - `src/lib/supabase/server.ts` - Server client
  - `src/lib/supabase/middleware.ts` - Auth middleware
- ✅ Created root `middleware.ts` for route protection
- ✅ Created database migration SQL file: `supabase-migration.sql`

### ✅ AI Integration
- ✅ Replaced Genkit with Vercel AI SDK
- ✅ Created API route: `/api/suggest-appraiser/route.ts`
- ✅ Updated order form to use new API

### ✅ Data Layer
- ✅ Created React Query hooks:
  - `src/hooks/use-orders.ts` - Order CRUD operations
  - `src/hooks/use-clients.ts` - Client CRUD operations
  - `src/hooks/use-appraisers.ts` - Appraiser queries
- ✅ All hooks include loading states, error handling, and optimistic updates

### ✅ Authentication
- ✅ Created login/signup page: `src/app/login/page.tsx`
- ✅ Created auth provider: `src/components/auth/auth-provider.tsx`
- ✅ Updated providers to include AuthProvider
- ✅ Updated header with user info and sign out
- ✅ Protected routes with middleware

### ✅ Component Updates
- ✅ Orders page now uses `useOrders` hook
- ✅ Order form uses Supabase hooks for data
- ✅ Dashboard computes real-time stats
- ✅ Order status chart uses live data
- ✅ New order page loads data dynamically

### ✅ Documentation
- ✅ Updated README with comprehensive setup instructions
- ✅ Created `.env.example` file structure

## 🚀 Next Steps - Setup Instructions

### 1. Create Supabase Project

1. Go to [supabase.com](https://supabase.com) and create a new project
2. Wait for the project to finish setting up (~2 minutes)

### 2. Run Database Migration

1. In your Supabase project, go to **SQL Editor**
2. Click "New Query"
3. Copy the entire contents of `supabase-migration.sql`
4. Paste and click "Run"
5. Verify all tables were created successfully

### 3. Get Supabase Credentials

1. Go to **Settings** > **API** in your Supabase dashboard
2. Copy your **Project URL**
3. Copy your **anon/public key**

### 4. Create `.env.local` File

Create a file named `.env.local` in the root directory:

```bash
# Supabase Configuration
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL=https://your-project.supabase.co
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=your-anon-key-here

# AI Configuration (choose one)
OPENAI_API_KEY=sk-your-openai-key
# OR
ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=sk-ant-your-anthropic-key
```

### 5. Install Dependencies (if needed)

```bash
npm install
```

### 6. Start Development Server

```bash
npm run dev
```

### 7. Create Your First User

1. Open [http://localhost:9002](http://localhost:9002)
2. You'll be redirected to `/login`
3. Click "Sign Up"
4. Enter your details (use a real email)
5. Check your email for verification link
6. Click the link to verify
7. Sign in!

### 8. Add Test Data (Optional)

Since we're starting fresh, you'll need to add some data:

**Add Clients:**
- Go to Clients page
- Click "New Client"
- Add a few test clients

**Add Orders:**
- Go to Orders page
- Click "New Order"
- Fill out the form (the AI suggestion will work once you have appraisers)

---

## 📋 Database Tables Created

The migration created these tables:
- ✅ `profiles` - User profiles (auto-created on signup)
- ✅ `clients` - Client companies
- ✅ `orders` - Appraisal orders
- ✅ `order_history` - Change tracking
- ✅ `order_documents` - File uploads
- ✅ `order_notes` - Comments/notes

All tables have Row Level Security (RLS) enabled!

---

## 🔐 Authentication Flow

1. User signs up → Supabase creates auth user
2. Trigger automatically creates profile in `profiles` table
3. Middleware checks auth on protected routes
4. User data available via `useCurrentUser()` hook

---

## 🤖 AI Features

The AI appraiser suggestion works by:
1. Analyzing property location
2. Checking appraiser geographic coverage
3. Considering current workload
4. Factoring in ratings
5. Prioritizing by order priority

**Cost:** ~$0.01-0.02 per suggestion with GPT-4

---

## 🚢 Deploy to Vercel

1. Push code to GitHub
2. Import project in Vercel
3. Add environment variables in Vercel dashboard
4. Deploy!

---

## ⚠️ Important Notes

### Environment Variables
- **NEVER** commit `.env.local` to git (it's already in `.gitignore`)
- Set environment variables in Vercel for production

### Supabase Email Settings
- By default, Supabase requires email verification
- For development, you can disable this in Supabase dashboard:
  - Go to **Authentication** > **Settings**
  - Toggle "Enable email confirmations"

### Row Level Security
- All tables have RLS enabled
- Users can only access data they're authenticated to see
- Modify policies in Supabase dashboard if needed

### AI Provider Choice
- OpenAI (recommended): More consistent, better at following instructions
- Anthropic: Alternative option, similar quality
- You can switch providers anytime by updating the API key

---

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### "Invalid API key" error
- Check your environment variables are correct
- Restart dev server after changing `.env.local`

### "Unauthorized" errors
- Make sure you're signed in
- Check that RLS policies are set up correctly
- Verify middleware is running (check console)

### AI suggestions not working
- Verify you have an API key set
- Check the console for errors
- Make sure you have appraisers in the database

### Database connection issues
- Verify Supabase URL and key are correct
- Check your Supabase project is active
- Ensure migration script ran successfully
