## 🎯 What's Been Built

### Code Files:
1. ✅ `src/lib/research/web-search.ts` - Tavily & Brave API integration
2. ✅ `src/lib/research/internal-search.ts` - Database aggregation  
3. ✅ `src/lib/research/summarizer.ts` - AI summarization

## 🚀 HOW TO TEST (3 Options)

### Option 1: Via Supabase (Direct Database)

**Get the research card ID:**
```sql
SELECT id, title, state 
FROM kanban_cards 
WHERE type = 'research' 
  AND state = 'approved'
ORDER BY created_at DESC 
LIMIT 1;
```

Copy the ID, then execute via API in browser console:
```javascript
fetch('/api/agent/execute-card', {
  method: 'POST',
  headers: { 'Content-Type': 'application/json' },
  body: JSON.stringify({
    cardId: 'paste-id-here'
  })
}).then(r => r.json()).then(console.log);
```

### Option 2: Drag and Drop (UI)

1. Find research card in "Approved" column
2. **Drag it to "Executing" column**
3. This triggers the execution
4. Wait ~20 seconds
5. Card moves to "Done"

### Option 3: Ask Agent in Chat

Open chat and say:
```
"Execute the research task for iFund Cities"
```

The agent will trigger it (if tool calling is enabled).

---

## 📊 What Will Happen

### During Execution (~20 seconds):

**Step 1: Internal Data** (2-3s)
```
[Research] Starting research for client...
[Research] Gathered internal data: X orders, $X revenue
```

**Step 2: Web Search** (3-5s) - with Tavily key
```
[Research] Found 5 web results
- Result 1: iFund Cities - Real Estate Investment...
- Result 2: Company Profile...
etc.
```

**Step 3: AI Summary** (8-12s)
```
[Research] Generated summary (1500+ chars)
Creating comprehensive report with 6 sections...
```

**Step 4-6: Storage** (2-3s)
```
[Research] Saved to activities ✓
[Research] Indexed to RAG ✓
[Research] Saved insights to agent_memories ✓
```

**Done!**
```
✓ Research completed and indexed
Card → Done column
```

---

## 📝 Where to Find Results

### 1. Activities (Client Timeline)

Go to: **/clients** → Click **iFund Cities**

Look for:
```
Activity Type: note
Subject: Research Complete: ifund Cities
Date: [today]
Description: [Full AI summary with 6 sections]
```

### 2. RAG (Knowledge Base)

In **Supabase**:
```sql
SELECT title, content, metadata 
FROM embeddings_index 
WHERE source = 'research' 
ORDER BY created_at DESC;
```

Or in **Chat**:
```
"Tell me about iFund Cities"
"What did we research about iFund?"
```

Agent will find and reference the research!

### 3. Agent Memories

In **Supabase**:
```sql
SELECT key, content 
FROM agent_memories 
WHERE scope = 'client_context' 
ORDER BY created_at DESC;
```

These auto-load in future agent planning runs!

## 🧪 Quick Test Command

**In browser console at http://localhost:9002/agent:**

```javascript
// This will work once you have the card ID
// Get all approved cards
fetch('/api/agent/run')
  .then(r => r.json())
  .then(data => console.log('Cards:', data));

// Or just approve and drag the card!
```
