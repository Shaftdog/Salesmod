## Next Steps

### Phase 3: Suggestions & Learning (Optional)
If you want to continue, the next phase includes:
1. **Suggestion Engine**: Background job to analyze all clients
2. **Client Intelligence Panel**: AI insights on client detail page
3. **Feedback Collection**: Thumbs up/down on drafts
4. **Analytics Dashboard**: Performance metrics for AI

### Or Test & Refine Current Features
- Generate drafts for multiple clients
- Test different draft types and tones
- Monitor API costs in usage logs
- Gather user feedback

---

## Cost Monitoring

Current implementation logs all AI usage to `ai_usage_logs` table.

**To view costs**:
```sql
-- Total cost this month
SELECT SUM(estimated_cost) as total_cost
FROM ai_usage_logs
WHERE created_at > DATE_TRUNC('month', NOW());

-- Cost by user
SELECT * FROM ai_usage_by_user;

-- Cost by operation type
SELECT 
  operation_type,
  COUNT(*) as operations,
  SUM(tokens_used) as total_tokens,
  SUM(estimated_cost) as total_cost
FROM ai_usage_logs
WHERE created_at > NOW() - INTERVAL '30 days'
GROUP BY operation_type;
```

---

## Known Limitations

1. **Email Sending**: Drafts are currently "copy to clipboard" only. Future: integrate SendGrid/Resend.
2. **Suggestion Generation**: Currently on-demand. Future: background job.
3. **Multi-language**: English only. Future: detect client language.
4. **Rich Text**: Plain text only. Future: HTML email templates.
5. **Attachments**: Not supported yet. Future: attach files to drafts.

## API Key Setup Reminder

Don't forget to add to `.env.local`:
```bash
OPENAI_API_KEY=sk-...your-key-here...
```

Get your API key from: https://platform.openai.com/api-keys
