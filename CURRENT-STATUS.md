**What You Need To Do:**

   - Verify your email

2. **Get Your API Key**
   - Dashboard → API Keys
   - Create new key
   - Copy it (starts with `re_`)

3. **Add to .env.local**
   - Replace: `RESEND_API_KEY=re_YOUR_API_KEY_HERE`
   - With: `RESEND_API_KEY=re_your_actual_key`
   - Save file

4. **Restart Server** (if needed)
   ```bash
   pkill -f "next dev"
   npm run dev
   ```
