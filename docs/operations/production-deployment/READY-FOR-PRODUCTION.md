- "How can I close the gap?" → Agent advises

**Autonomous Agent = Actions** (Creates, Executes)
- Runs every 2 hours
- Creates action cards
- Proposes emails, tasks, calls, deals

**UI = Approvals** (Review, Approve, Execute)
- Review cards on Kanban
- Approve with one click
- Execute immediately

**Together = Complete System!**
