# ✅ Tool Schema Fix - COMPLETE!

## 🐛 Problem
After switching to `/api/agent/chat`, got this error:
```
AI_APICallError: tools.0.custom.input_schema.type: Field required
```

## 🔧 Root Cause
The tool definitions in `/src/lib/agent/tools.ts` were using `(tool as any)` type casts, which prevented the AI SDK from generating proper schemas for Anthropic's API.

Anthropic requires tool schemas with explicit `type` fields, but the type casting broke the schema generation.

## ✅ Solution
Removed all `as any` casts from tool definitions:

**Before**:
```typescript
export const agentTools: any = {
  searchClients: (tool as any)({
    // ...
  } as any),
}
```

**After**:
```typescript
export const agentTools = {
  searchClients: tool({
    // ...
  }),
}
```

This allows the AI SDK to properly infer types and generate valid Anthropic API schemas.

## 🧪 Test Again
The dev server should auto-reload. Try:
```
Create an email card for iFund Cities to follow up on their October orders
```

Should work now without the schema error!

## 📝 Changes Made
- File: `/src/lib/agent/tools.ts`
- Changed: Removed all `(tool as any)` and ` as any)` casts
- Result: Proper TypeScript types → Proper API schemas

**Status**: ✅ Fixed  
**Next**: Test card creation again
