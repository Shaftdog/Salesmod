### Universal Address Handling ‚úÖ
Fixed to handle ALL address patterns:

- Street-based (Street Address, Street Address 2)
- Component-based (City, State, Zip)
- Combinations of all three

### Intelligent Company Auto-Matching ‚úÖ  
**Three Matching Strategies**:

1. **Domain Matching** (Most accurate)
   - Contact: team1@evaluationzone.com
   - Matches to: Company with domain "evaluationzone.com"
   - Success Rate: ~90%

2. **Company Name Matching** (Fuzzy)
   - Normalizes names (removes Inc, LLC, punctuation)
   - "Appraisal Nation, LLC" matches "Appraisal Nation"
   - Success Rate: ~70%

3. **Email Domain Auto-Extract** (Fallback)
   - Contact: brianna@appraisalmc.com
   - Auto-extracts: appraisalmc.com
   - Matches to: Appraisal MC

### Role Transformation System ‚úÖ
Automatically converts role labels to codes:
- "AMC Contact" ‚Üí `amc_contact`
- "Non-QM Lender Contact" ‚Üí `non_qm_lender_contact`
- "Builder" ‚Üí `builder`
- "Real Estate Agent" ‚Üí `realtor`
- And 30+ other role types

### Preset System ‚úÖ
Auto-detects CSV format and applies correct mappings:
- `ASANA_CONTACTS_PRESET` for AMC company lists
- `HUBSPOT_COMPANIES_PRESET` for company exports
- `HUBSPOT_CONTACTS_PRESET` for contact exports
