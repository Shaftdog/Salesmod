# 🤖 Agent Chat + RAG - Ready to Test!

## ✅ IMPLEMENTATION COMPLETE!

I've successfully implemented **conversational AI with knowledge base search** for your Account Manager Agent!

---

## 🚀 Quick Setup (5 Minutes)

### Step 1: Apply Chat+RAG Migration

Go to **Supabase SQL Editor** and run:

**File:** `RUN-THIS-FOR-CHAT-RAG.sql`

This creates:
- ✅ `embeddings_index` table (pgvector for semantic search)
- ✅ `chat_messages` table (conversation history)
- ✅ `search_embeddings()` function (cosine similarity)
- ✅ RLS policies
- ✅ Triggers

---

### Step 2: Index Your Data (30 seconds)

Open http://localhost:9002/agent in your browser, then in the console run:

```javascript
// Index all your clients and activities into the knowledge base
fetch('/api/rag/index-all', {
  method: 'POST',
  headers: {
    'Content-Type': 'application/json',
  },
}).then(r => r.json()).then(result => {
  console.log('✓ Indexed:', result);
  console.log(`Total: ${result.totalIndexed} items`);
  console.log(`Clients: ${result.clients}`);
  console.log(`Activities: ${result.activities}`);
});
```

Wait ~30-60 seconds. You'll see:
```
✓ Indexed: {totalIndexed: 502, clients: 2, activities: 500}
```

---

### Step 3: Start Chatting!

1. Go to http://localhost:9002/agent
2. Click **"Agent Control Panel"** button
3. Click the **"Chat"** tab (new!)
4. You'll see a chat interface with quick action buttons

---

## 💬 Try These Conversations

### Ask About Goals

Type: **"What are my goals?"**

Agent will:
- Use `getGoals` tool automatically
- Calculate progress for each goal
- Show you're 95-98% behind
- Recommend high-priority actions

---

### Search for a Client

Type: **"Tell me about ifund Cities"**

Agent will:
- Use `searchClients` tool to find them
- Use `searchKnowledge` (RAG) to find related info
- Summarize their status
- Mention the 999 days no contact
- Reference the email card you created

---

### Create an Action

Type: **"Draft a thank you email to Acme for their recent order"**

Agent will:
- Use `createCard` tool
- Generate email with subject and body
- Create a card in "Suggested" column
- Confirm it's ready for review

---

### Search Knowledge Base

Type: **"Find any mentions of volume pricing"**

Agent will:
- Use `searchKnowledge` (RAG)
- Search semantically across all indexed content
- Return relevant matches with similarity scores
- Cite sources

---

### Get Pending Items

Type: **"What needs my attention?"**

Agent will:
- Use `getPendingCards` tool
- List all suggested/approved cards
- Prioritize by importance
- Recommend what to approve first

---

## 🛠️ Agent Tools Available

The agent automatically uses these tools based on your question:

1. **searchClients** - Find clients by name/email
2. **getGoals** - Check goal progress
3. **createCard** - Make action cards via chat
4. **searchKnowledge** - RAG semantic search
5. **getClientActivity** - View client history
6. **getPendingCards** - See what needs review
7. **getRunHistory** - Agent performance stats

**You don't call these manually** - the agent decides which to use!

## 🎯 Usage Examples

### Natural Questions:

```
"How am I tracking on revenue?"
"What clients need follow-up?"
"Who is ifund Cities?"
"What was our last interaction with Acme?"
"Find mentions of volume pricing in our records"
```

### Commands:

```
"Draft an email to Acme thanking them for their order"
"Create a task to call iFund next Tuesday"
"Schedule a strategy call with Acme"
"Create a $20k deal opportunity for ifund"
```

### Analysis:

```
"Why did you propose that email to iFund?"
"What's the best way to close the revenue gap?"
"Which client should I contact first?"
"Analyze recent client engagement"
```

---

## 🔍 How RAG Works

**When you ask a question:**

1. Your question → OpenAI embedding (vector)
2. Search `embeddings_index` using cosine similarity
3. Find top 3-5 most relevant items (70%+ match)
4. Agent reads the context
5. Agent formulates answer using that knowledge
6. Agent cites sources when relevant

**Example:**

You: "Find info about volume pricing"

RAG finds:
- Email draft to iFund mentioning "volume pricing packages"
- Deal card "Acme Q4 Package" with "volume-based pricing" 
- Activity note about "volume discount discussion"

Agent synthesizes and responds with citations!

## 📈 What This Unlocks

### Before (Phase 1):
- Agent creates cards every 2 hours
- You review and approve
- One-way: Agent → You

### Now (Chat + RAG):
- **Two-way conversation!**
- Ask questions → Get instant answers
- Give commands → Agent executes
- Search history → Find anything
- Collaborative planning

### Workflow Transformation:

**Old:**
1. Wait for agent to run
2. Review generated cards
3. Guess why agent suggested something

**New:**
1. Ask: "What should I do about iFund?"
2. Agent: [searches RAG, analyzes, recommends]
3. You: "Draft an email"
4. Agent: [creates card immediately]
5. You: "Why this approach?"
6. Agent: [explains with data citations]

**Faster, smarter, more transparent!**

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

**If chat doesn't load:**
- Check browser console for errors
- Verify migration ran successfully
- Refresh the page

**If agent doesn't respond:**
- Check ANTHROPIC_API_KEY is set
- Check OPENAI_API_KEY is set (for embeddings)
- Look at server logs for errors

**If RAG returns no results:**
- Run the indexing script
- Wait for it to complete
- Verify embeddings_index has data:
  ```sql
  SELECT count(*) FROM embeddings_index;
  ```

**If tools don't work:**
- Check database has data (clients, goals, etc.)
- Verify RLS policies allow access
- Check server logs for tool execution errors
