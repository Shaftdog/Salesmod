## Verification - Auto-Matching is Working! ‚úÖ

### Example 1: Appraisal MC
**Company**: Appraisal MC (appraisalmc.com domain)
**Contacts Auto-Matched**: 6 contacts ‚úÖ

Successfully matched contacts:
1. info@appraisalmc.com A
2. Brianna Frerich (brianna@appraisalmc.com)
3. Kathryn null (kathryn@appraisalmc.com) 
4. Kelli Stevens (kelli@appraisalmc.com)
5. Kailey Webb (kailey@appraisalmc.com)
6. Julie Wolpert (julie@appraisalmc.com)

**Matching Method**: Email domain extraction (@appraisalmc.com ‚Üí matched to company with domain)

### Example 2: [Unassigned Contacts]
**Total Unassigned**: 129 contacts

**Types of Unassigned Contacts**:
- Generic email addresses (appraisals@, info@, orders@)
- Domains not matching any company (e.g., @ca-usa.com has no matching company)
- Contacts without company information in CSV
- Contacts from companies not yet imported

**Example Unassigned Contacts**:
- emma@appraisalvaluationservicesllc.com
- appraisals@rpm-appraisals.com
- appraisals@onestopappraisals.com
- appraisals@valuequestamc.com
- appraisal@landsafe.com
- appraisal@usaappraisal.com

## How Auto-Matching Worked

The system used **3 matching strategies**:

### 1. Company Name Direct Match (from CSV "Company Name" column)
```
CSV: Company Name = "Appraisal MC"
System: Normalizes ‚Üí "appraisal mc"
Searches: All clients for matching normalized name
Result: ‚úÖ Matches to existing "Appraisal MC"
```

### 2. Email Domain Extraction (Automatic)
```
CSV: Email = "brianna@appraisalmc.com"  
System: Extracts domain ‚Üí "appraisalmc.com"
Searches: Clients with matching domain
Result: ‚úÖ Matches to "Appraisal MC" (domain: appraisalmc.com)
```

### 3. Fallback to [Unassigned Contacts]
```
CSV: Email = "appraisals@rpm-appraisals.com"
System: Extracts domain ‚Üí "rpm-appraisals.com"
Searches: No company with this domain
Result: ‚ÑπÔ∏è Assigned to "[Unassigned Contacts]" for manual review
Flagged: props.needs_company_assignment = true
```

## Role Mapping - Working Perfectly! ‚úÖ

The "Contact type" column mapped to roles successfully:
- AMC Contact ‚Üí `amc_contact`
- AMC Billing Contact ‚Üí `amc_billing_contact`
- Non-QM Lender Contact ‚Üí `non_qm_lender_contact`
- Builder ‚Üí `builder`
- Real Estate Agent ‚Üí `realtor`
- Attorney ‚Üí `attorney`
- Wholesaler ‚Üí `wholesaler`
- And many more...

All roles automatically transformed and displaying correctly!

## What Happened to the 25 Errors?

All 25 errors were:
```
Error: "Invalid phone format: null"
```

**Cause**: CSV had literal text "null" in phone number fields instead of empty

**Impact**: These 25 contacts were logged as errors and skipped

**No Data Loss**: You can review the migration errors in the Import History and manually add these 25 contacts if needed

---

## Next Steps - Manual Review

### To Assign Unassigned Contacts:

1. **Navigate to "[Unassigned Contacts]" company** ‚úÖ (Already there)
2. **Review the 129 unassigned contacts**
3. **Manually assign each to the correct company**:
   - Click contact ‚Üí Edit ‚Üí Select correct company ‚Üí Save
4. **Or leave them unassigned** if they're not important

### Common Reasons for Unassigned:

- **Email domain doesn't match** (e.g., @ca-usa.com vs consolidatedanalytics.com)
- **Generic email addresses** (appraisals@, orders@, info@)
- **Company not in your database** (need to import that company first)
- **No company info in CSV** (blank Company Name field)
