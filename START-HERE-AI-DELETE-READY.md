   - Tool-based (`/chat`) is more powerful and recommended
   - Both now support full delete/update operations

3. **Natural Language:**
   - The AI understands variations
   - Just talk naturally - "delete", "remove", "get rid of" all work

---

## 🆘 Need Help?

**If delete doesn't work:**
1. Check browser console for errors
2. Verify you're authenticated
3. Make sure cards exist that match criteria
4. Try more specific criteria (e.g., card ID)

**If AI doesn't understand:**
- Use imperative commands ("Delete..." not "Can you delete...")
- Be specific about what to delete ("Delete all low priority cards")
- Check that items exist before trying to delete

**Still stuck?**
- See `TEST-AI-AGENT-DELETE.md` for troubleshooting
- Check network tab for API responses
- Verify Supabase connection is working
