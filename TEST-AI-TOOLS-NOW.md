# 🧪 TEST: AI Agent with Real Tools

## 🎯 What I Changed

I created a **minimal tool implementation** to test if AI SDK tools can work at all:

1. **Created**: `/src/lib/agent/tools-simple.ts` - Just ONE tool (`createCard`)
2. **Created**: `/src/app/api/agent/chat-test/route.ts` - Test endpoint
3. **Updated**: Chat component to use `/api/agent/chat-test`

## 🚀 Test It Now!

The dev server should auto-reload in ~10 seconds.

### Step 1: Refresh your browser
- Go to: http://localhost:9002/agent
- Hard refresh: Cmd+Shift+R

### Step 2: Type this in chat:
```
Create a high priority task card Holiday Client Appreciation to send thank you messages to top 20 clients
```

### Step 3: Watch for Results

**If it WORKS** (tools working!) you'll see:
- ✅ Server logs: `[Chat Test] Tool call: createCard`
- ✅ Server logs: `[Chat Test] Tool result: createCard { success: true }`
- ✅ Agent responds confirming card creation
- ✅ Card appears in Suggested column within 5 seconds

**If it FAILS** (same schema error) you'll see:
- ❌ Server logs: `AI_APICallError: tools.0.custom.input_schema.type: Field required`
- ❌ No card created
- ❌ Agent doesn't respond or responds with error

## 🔬 What This Test Tells Us

### If Minimal Tool Works:
→ The issue is with one of the complex tools (searchClients, getGoals, etc.)  
→ Solution: Simplify those tools or remove problematic ones

### If Minimal Tool Fails:
→ AI SDK + Anthropic has fundamental incompatibility  
→ Solution: Use native Anthropic SDK instead of AI SDK, or stick with command parser

## 📊 Current State

- ✅ Deleted all test cards (board is empty)
- ✅ Created minimal tool with just `createCard`
- ✅ Chat component uses `/api/agent/chat-test`
- ⏳ Waiting for server to reload
- ⏳ Ready to test!
