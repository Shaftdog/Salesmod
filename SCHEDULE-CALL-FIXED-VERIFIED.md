# ✅ Schedule Call Fix - Tested & Verified Working

## Problem

When `schedule_call` cards executed, they:
- ❌ Only created activity timeline entries
- ❌ No actual task created in tasks table
- ❌ No actionable reminder for the user
- ❌ Marked as "completed" even though no call was made

## Solution

Updated `executeScheduleCall()` to create **real tasks** that appear in the Tasks page.

## What Happens Now

When a `schedule_call` card executes:

1. ✅ **Creates actual task** in `tasks` table
   - Title: Card title
   - Description: Rationale + call purpose + duration
   - Priority: Correctly mapped (high/normal/low)
   - Due Date: 2 days from execution (default)
   - Status: pending
   - Assigned to: User

2. ✅ **Creates activity record** in timeline
   - Type: task
   - Subject: "Task Created: [title]"
   - Description: Explains this is for user to complete
   - Status: scheduled

3. ✅ **Task appears in /tasks page**
   - Shows in Active tasks list
   - Can be checked off when completed
   - Linked to client

## Verification Test Results

### Test Executed:
- Created `schedule_call` card: "Test: Strategy call with Acme team"
- Executed the card
- Verified results

### Results:
✅ **Task created in database** - ID: d9198500-2182-4c2f-8df6-4992e3a7cbaa  
✅ **Task visible in /tasks page** - Shows with high priority, due Oct 19  
✅ **Activity created** - Shows in Acme timeline (6 activities total)  
✅ **Task is actionable** - Has checkbox, can be completed  

### Screenshots:
- `tasks-page.png` - Shows task in Tasks list
- Task details include full rationale and call purpose

## Code Changes

**File: `src/lib/agent/executor.ts`**

Changed `executeScheduleCall()` to:
1. Create task in `tasks` table (not just activity)
2. Map priority correctly
3. Set due date
4. Create activity record for audit trail
5. Return task ID in metadata

## Backward Compatibility

✅ Works on **existing** `schedule_call` cards  
✅ Works on **future** cards (though new ones won't be created)

## Action Types Going Forward

The AI will no longer create `schedule_call` cards. Instead:
- For calls/meetings: Creates `create_task` with title like "Call [client] to discuss [topic]"
- These task cards execute and create actual tasks
- Same behavior, clearer intent

## Status

✅ **schedule_call executor fixed**  
✅ **Verified creating actual tasks**  
✅ **Verified tasks appear in /tasks page**  
✅ **Verified activities logged**  
✅ **Works on existing and future cards**  

**Ready to use!**
