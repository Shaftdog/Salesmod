# 🌐 Web Search in Chat - READY!

## ✅ IMPLEMENTED AND WORKING!

---

## 🎯 How It Works

### Automatic Detection:

When you say phrases like:
- "Search for..."
- "Find information about..."
- "Look up..."
- "What is [something]?"

**The agent automatically:**
1. Detects you want web search
2. Calls Tavily API (or Brave)
3. Gets 3-5 web results
4. Injects results into conversation
5. References them in the response

**You don't need to do anything special** - just ask naturally!

## 💬 Example Conversations

### Example 1: Company Research

**You:** "Search for information about iFund Cities"

**Agent:**
```
(Automatically searches Tavily)

Based on web search results:

1. **iFund Cities - Real Estate Investment Firm**
   Leading commercial property investment company specializing in multi-family 
   and retail properties...
   Source: example.com

2. **iFund Cities Expands Q4 Portfolio**
   Company announces major acquisition strategy for Q4 2025...
   Source: realestatebiz.com

3. **iFund Cities Company Profile**
   Founded in 2018, focuses on commercial real estate with $50M+ portfolio...
   Source: linkedin.com

Based on this research and our internal data (1 order, $1,250, 999 days no contact),
I recommend we re-engage them immediately. They're expanding Q4 - perfect timing!

Would you like me to draft a re-engagement email emphasizing our fast-turnaround 
services for their acquisition needs?
```

### Example 2: Industry Information

**You:** "What is the current state of the commercial appraisal market?"

**Agent:**
```
(Searches: "commercial appraisal market 2025")

Here's what I found:

1. **Commercial Real Estate Appraisal Trends 2025**
   Market showing strong growth driven by post-pandemic recovery...
   
2. **Appraisal Demand Surges in Q4**
   Year-end transactions creating high demand for quick turnarounds...

3. **Technology in Property Appraisals**
   AI and automation changing the industry landscape...

This aligns with your Q4 goals. The high demand for quick turnarounds is 
exactly what we should emphasize with clients like iFund and Acme.
```

### Example 3: Competitor Research

**You:** "Search for competing AMCs in our area"

**Agent:**
```
(Searches and returns results)

Found several competitors:
- [Competitor names and details from web]
- [Services they offer]
- [Pricing information if available]

Based on this, here's how we differentiate:
1. Faster turnaround times
2. Better client relationships
3. Specialized services

Should I create a competitive analysis report?

## 🔍 How Search Detection Works

**Triggers web search when you say:**
- ✅ "search" (any variation)
- ✅ "find information"
- ✅ "look up"
- ✅ "what is" + question mark

**Examples that trigger:**
- "Search for X"
- "Can you search for Y"
- "Find information about Z"
- "Look up company ABC"
- "What is XYZ?"

**Won't trigger on:**
- "Tell me about [client in database]" (uses internal data)
- "What are my goals?" (uses database)
- Normal conversation

---

## 📊 What Gets Searched

**The agent sends your EXACT question to Tavily:**

You: "Search for iFund Cities"  
→ Tavily searches: "Search for iFund Cities"

You: "What is iFund Cities?"  
→ Tavily searches: "What is iFund Cities?"

**Returns:**
- 3-5 most relevant web pages
- Title, URL, snippet for each
- Injected into agent's context
- Agent references in response
