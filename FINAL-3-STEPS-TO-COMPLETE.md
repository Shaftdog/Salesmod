- All 9 unassigned orders to correct clients

**Steps:**
1. Same SQL Editor
2. Copy/paste entire file

---

### âœ… STEP 3: Verify Everything is Perfect

Run this verification query:

```sql
-- Should show all 20 orders across 8 clients
SELECT 
  c.company_name,
  c.client_type,
  COUNT(o.id) as order_count,
  SUM(o.fee_amount)::money as total_revenue
FROM orders o
JOIN clients c ON o.client_id = c.id
WHERE o.source = 'asana'
GROUP BY c.company_name, c.client_type
ORDER BY order_count DESC;

-- Should return 0 (no unassigned orders)
SELECT COUNT(*) as unassigned_orders
FROM orders o
JOIN clients c ON o.client_id = c.id
WHERE c.company_name = '[Unassigned Orders]'
  AND o.source = 'asana';
```

**Expected Output:**
- i Fund Cities LLC (company) - 6 orders
- Applied Valuation Services (company) - 5 orders
