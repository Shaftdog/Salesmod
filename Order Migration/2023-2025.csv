Any Specific Client Instruction?:
The borrower has informed me that the subject property is being split into two townhomes on two separate lots. They will be providing me with the parcel ID numbers for each lot shortly. Given this new information, it would be more appropriate to perform two separate appraisals, one for each lot, using the 1004 single-family form instead of the originally requested 1025 form, which is intended for 2-4 unit properties. To proceed with the appraisals accurately, I kindly request that you send back two separate appraisal orders with the following property addresses:  807 E. Ida St Unit A, Tampa, FL 33603 807 E. Ida St Unit B, Tampa, FL 33603  Please update the appraisal type and form for each order to reflect the 1004 single-family form. All other requirements, such as the ARV, ASIS, and Rent Analysis (post-construction/renovation), as well as the comparable requirements, can remain the same for each order. I appreciate your understanding and assistance in making this necessary change to ensure the accuracy and appropriateness of the appraisal reports. Please let me know if you have any questions or require any additional information from my end.
