## 🚀 TEST YOUR AI AGENT NOW!

### Step 1: Open Agent Page

Go to: **http://localhost:9002/agent**

You should see:
- AI Agent Manager header
- 4 stats cards (all zeros)

- "Agent Control Panel" button

### Step 2: Start Agent Cycle

1. Click **"Agent Control Panel"** button (top right)
2. Panel slides in from right
3. Click **"Start Agent Cycle"** button
4. Wait 30-60 seconds (AI is thinking!)

**What happens:**
- Agent analyzes your 3 goals
- Calculates goal pressure (you're behind on all - high pressure!)
- Ranks your 2 clients (Acme Real Estate, ifund Cities)
- Generates 3-7 intelligent action proposals
- Creates Kanban cards

### Step 3: Review Generated Cards

Cards will appear on the Kanban board in the **"Suggested"** column:

Each card shows:
- 📧 Type icon (email, task, call, etc.)
- Title of the action
- Client name
- Priority badge (high/medium/low)
- Brief rationale

### Step 4: Review an Email Draft

1. **Click on an email card** (📧 icon)
2. Email Draft Sheet opens showing:
   - **To:** Client/contact email
   - **Subject:** AI-generated subject line
   - **Why This Email?:** Rationale from the agent
   - **Message:** Full HTML email draft (personalized!)
   - Priority and client info

### Step 5: Approve & Send

Click one of these buttons:
- **"Reject"** - Dismiss this action
- **"Approve"** - Approve for later execution
- **"Approve & Send"** - Send immediately (via Resend!)

### Step 6: Verify Email Sent

**Check Resend Dashboard:**
1. Go to https://resend.com
2. Click "Emails" in sidebar
3. You should see your sent email listed!
4. View delivery status, opens, clicks

**Check Your App:**
1. Card moves to "Done" column
2. Stats update (Emails Sent: 1)
3. Activity logged in database

## 📊 What to Expect

### Example Actions the Agent Might Create:

**With 3 behind-schedule goals, the agent should propose:**

1. **📧 Email: Check-in with Acme Real Estate**
   - Type: send_email
   - Priority: High
   - Rationale: "Client has 1 active order but no recent contact in 7+ days. Revenue goal is significantly behind target. Opportunity to discuss additional appraisals or referrals."
   - Draft: Personalized email referencing their recent order

2. **📧 Email: Follow-up with ifund Cities**
   - Type: send_email
   - Priority: High
   - Rationale: "Active client with recent order. Revenue goals far behind. Good candidate for discussing volume opportunities or premium services."
   - Draft: Contextual follow-up

3. **📝 Task: Research new client opportunities**
   - Type: create_task
   - Priority: Medium
   - Rationale: "Need to close revenue gap. Research potential new clients in existing client networks."

4. **💰 Deal: Propose volume discount to Acme**
   - Type: create_deal
   - Priority: High
   - Rationale: "Client has consistent needs. Volume deal could help close order volume gap (2/60)."

5. **📞 Call: Schedule strategy session**
   - Type: schedule_call
   - Priority: Medium
   - Rationale: "Discuss Q4 goals and how to accelerate order volume."

## 🔧 If Something Goes Wrong

### Agent Creates No Cards

**Check:**
```sql
-- View the last run in Supabase SQL Editor
SELECT * FROM agent_runs ORDER BY started_at DESC LIMIT 1;

-- Check for errors
SELECT errors FROM agent_runs ORDER BY started_at DESC LIMIT 1;
```

**Common issues:**
- ANTHROPIC_API_KEY not set (check .env.local)
- No active goals or clients
- Error in agent logic

**Fix:** Check terminal logs for errors

### "Unauthorized" Error

This should be fixed now with the auth token update. If it still happens:
- Refresh the page
- Log out and log back in
- Check browser console for errors

### Email Doesn't Send

**Check Resend:**
- API key is correct
- Domain is verified (or using test domain)
- No rate limits exceeded

**Check App:**
- No suppressions for that contact
- Daily limit not reached (50/day)
- Contact has valid email address
