## 💬 Example Chat Sessions

### Session 1: Understanding Your Business

**You:** "What are my goals?"

**Agent:** 
```
[Uses getGoals tool]

You have 3 active goals:

📊 Revenue: $1,250 / $100,000 (1.3% complete)
   Status: 98.8% behind schedule ⚠️
   Gap: $98,750
   Days left: 17

📊 Revenue: $1,250 / $30,000 (4.2% complete)
   Status: 95.8% behind schedule ⚠️
   Gap: $28,750
   Days left: 17

📊 Order Volume: 2 / 60 (3.3% complete)
   Status: 96.7% behind schedule ⚠️
   Gap: 58 orders
   Days left: 17

You're significantly behind on all goals. I recommend approving the 
high-priority action cards to accelerate progress.
```

### Session 2: Client Intelligence

**You:** "Tell me about ifund Cities"

**Agent:**
```
[Uses searchClients + searchKnowledge tools]

iFund Cities:
- Company: ifund Cities
- Email: rod@myroihome.com
- RFM Score: 43% (high-value client)
- Last Contact: 999 days ago ⚠️
- Status: Dormant but historically valuable

From knowledge base:
- Previous appraisal services used successfully
- No recent orders or communications
- Identified as highest priority for re-engagement

Current Actions:
- I've created an urgent re-engagement email (currently in "Approved" column)
- Proposed volume pricing package
- Research task to gather current intel

Recommendation: Approve the email card to reconnect with this valuable client.
```

---

### Session 3: Create Actions

**You:** "Draft a thank you email to Acme for order APR-2025-1001"

**Agent:**
```
[Uses createCard tool]

Creating email draft for Acme Real Estate...

✓ Done! Card created: "Thank You - Order APR-2025-1001"

Email details:
- To: Acme Real Estate
- Subject: "Thank You for Your Business - Order APR-2025-1001"
- Content includes:
  * Appreciation for their business
  * Quality assurance
  * Invitation to discuss future needs
  * Request for referrals

The card is in the "Suggested" column on your Kanban board.

Would you like me to adjust anything before you approve it?
```

### Session 4: Strategic Advice

**You:** "How can I close the revenue gap this month?"

**Agent:**
```
[Uses getGoals, getPendingCards, searchKnowledge tools]

With $98,750 to close in 17 days, here's my recommendation:

Immediate Actions (Approve Now):
1. Re-engage iFund Cities (email in Approved column)
   - 43% RFM score = high conversion potential
   - Volume deal could yield $20-30k

2. Acme Q4 Package ($15k deal proposed)
   - Already engaged, warm lead
   - Volume pricing accepted by similar clients

3. Schedule strategy calls (2 cards suggested)
   - Identify immediate order opportunities
   - Discuss Q4 pipeline

Strategic Approach:
- Focus on existing clients (faster close)
- Emphasize volume deals (higher value)
- Leverage end-of-quarter timing
- Use successful case studies from knowledge base

I can draft additional emails or create more action cards if needed.

What would you like to prioritize first?
