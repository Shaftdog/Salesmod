## ‚ö†Ô∏è ONGOING ISSUE

### Chat Message Persistence
**Symptom**: New chat conversations aren't appearing in the UI after being sent

**Possible Causes**:
1. **Messages ARE saved** but UI isn't refreshing (most likely)
2. **Messages NOT saved** due to database/RLS issue
3. **Browser state frozen** and needs hard refresh

**Next Steps to Diagnose**:

#### Step 1: Hard Refresh Browser
```
Cmd+Shift+R (Mac) or Ctrl+Shift+R (Windows)
```
This clears cached state and forces fresh data load.

#### Step 2: Check Supabase Database
I created `CHECK-CHAT-MESSAGES.sql` with diagnostic queries:
1. Go to your Supabase project: https://zqhenxhgcjxslpfezybm.supabase.co
2. Open SQL Editor
3. Run the queries in `CHECK-CHAT-MESSAGES.sql`
4. This will tell you if messages ARE being saved

#### Step 3: Check Browser Console
After refresh:
1. Open Agent Control Panel
2. Open browser DevTools (F12)
3. Look for: `[ChatMessages] Loaded X messages from database`
4. Send test message: "Hello"
5. Look for: `[ChatMessages] Saving message:` logs
