# AI Agent Email Draft Fix

## Problem
The AI Agent was generating action cards for emails but not populating the Subject and Message (body) fields. The cards would show:
- ✅ "To" field populated
- ✅ "Why This Email?" (rationale) populated
- ❌ "Subject" field empty
- ❌ "Message" field empty

## Root Cause
The AI was not properly understanding that it needed to include the `emailDraft` object with `subject` and `body` fields for `send_email` actions. The AI was putting all the content into the `rationale` field instead of properly structuring the email.

## Solution Implemented

### 1. Enhanced Planning Prompt (`src/lib/agent/planner.ts`)
- Added a "CRITICAL: Action Requirements" section that explicitly explains:
  - For `send_email` actions, you MUST include the complete `emailDraft` object
  - The `rationale` field explains WHY you're sending the email (business reasoning)
  - The `emailDraft.body` contains the ACTUAL email message to send
  - These are separate fields!
- Made the requirements crystal clear with minimum character lengths and formatting guidelines

### 2. Improved Validation (`src/lib/agent/planner.ts`)
- Enhanced error messages to be more descriptive
- Added console logging when emailDraft is missing for debugging
- Error messages now include the action title for easier identification

### 3. Added Logging (`src/lib/agent/orchestrator.ts`)
- Added console logging when creating cards with emailDrafts
- Logs include subject/body presence and length
- Added error logging when send_email actions are missing emailDraft

### 4. Enhanced Chat Tool Validation (`src/lib/agent/tools.ts`)
- Added pre-flight validation for send_email actions
- Returns clear error messages if emailDraft is missing or invalid
- Added logging to track card creation via chat
- Updated tool description to be more explicit about requirements

## Files Modified
1. `/src/lib/agent/planner.ts` - Enhanced prompt and validation
2. `/src/lib/agent/orchestrator.ts` - Added logging and error detection
3. `/src/lib/agent/tools.ts` - Added validation and improved descriptions

## Testing Instructions

### 1. Test Automated Agent (Work Block)
1. Navigate to AI Agent Manager page
2. Click "Run Work Block" to trigger the automated agent
3. Wait for cards to be generated
4. Click on any email card (send_email type)
5. Verify:
   - ✅ "Subject" field is populated with a complete subject line
   - ✅ "Message" field is populated with HTML email content
   - ✅ "Why This Email?" field contains business reasoning (separate from email content)

### 2. Test Chat-Based Card Creation
1. Open the AI Agent chat
2. Ask: "Create an email card to reach out to LRES Corporation about increasing order volume"
3. Wait for the card to be created
4. Click on the card
5. Verify:
   - ✅ Subject and Message fields are populated
   - ✅ Rationale is separate from email content

### 3. Monitor Console Logs
While testing, check the browser console (F12) for:
- Logs showing "Creating card with emailDraft" with subject/body status
- Any error logs indicating missing emailDrafts

### 4. Check Server Logs
In the terminal where Next.js is running, look for:
- "Creating card with emailDraft" logs showing proper data
- "ERROR: send_email action missing emailDraft" if there are still issues

## Expected Behavior After Fix

### Email Draft Cards Should Show:
```
To: LRES Corporation
   Monica Phu (mphu@lrescorporation.com)
   [Medium Priority]

Why This Email?
Contact Monica Phu and Barbara Rosell (Vendor Management) to discuss 
service improvements and new offerings. Historical data shows previous 
volume of 8-12 orders/month - opportunity to reactivate.

Subject: Partnership Renewal Discussion - LRES Corporation

Message:
<p>Dear Monica,</p>
<p>I hope this message finds you well. I wanted to reach out regarding 
our partnership with LRES Corporation...</p>
[... rest of email content ...]
```

## Debugging

If emails are still missing subject/body after this fix:

1. **Check Console Logs**: Look for error messages about missing emailDraft
2. **Check Validation Errors**: The planner will log validation errors
3. **Inspect Card Data**: In browser console, check `card.action_payload` object
4. **Check AI Response**: Look at server logs for the AI's generated plan

## Additional Notes

- The `emailDraft.optional()` in the schema is intentional (for non-email actions)
- Validation happens at multiple levels: schema, business rules, and execution
- The AI uses Claude 3.5 Sonnet with structured output to ensure proper formatting
- Temperature is set to 0.5 for consistent formatting

## Next Steps

After verifying this fix works:
1. Monitor the first few agent runs to ensure consistency
2. If issues persist, consider making emailDraft conditionally required in the Zod schema
3. May want to add retry logic if the AI fails to provide proper email structure
